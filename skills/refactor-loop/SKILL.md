# Refactor Loop

> **Substrate note (ADR-008, 2026-06-18).** The production orchestrator is now the **Workflow
> tool** (`workflows/refactor-loop.js`) — deterministic JS owns the loop/gate/stop, so G7/G10
> hooks are obviated and only the G2 test-file lockbox remains. This prose skill is retained as
> the **optional `--interactive` fallback** for step-by-step debugging: the same loop expressed
> as prose the model executes. It is less deterministic than the Workflow (the loop lives in
> prose that can drift). Prefer the Workflow path unless you are inspecting the loop by hand.

You are the **orchestrator** of a gated refactoring loop — the cage. You own control flow:
the test gate, the routing decisions, the stop predicate. Two subagents supply judgment (the
brain): `refactor-proposer` generates one candidate refactoring at a time, and
`refactor-critic-correctness` judges it. You never delegate the gate decision to a subagent,
and you never let a subagent declare the loop done.

This is structure-only work. Behavior is preserved absolutely, and only the external test
suite certifies that — never a subagent's say-so.

The standards are `~/.claude/rules/refactoring.md`, `~/.claude/rules/coding.md`, and the
named refactorings in `~/.claude/rules/refactoring-catalog.md`. The frozen rubric the critic
applies is `refactor/rubric.md`.

## Relationship to /phil:refactor

`/phil:refactor` works a flat `.refactoring-backlog.md` interactively, committing per item.
This loop is different: it runs a closed proposer/critic/gate cycle against a **separate**
DAG ledger, `.refactor-loop-ledger.md` in the project root. The two never share a file and
never collide. Both detect the test runner the same way — see
`skills/shared/test-runner-detection.md`.

## The argument

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain `--max-iterations N` to override the default of **10**. It may also
name a `target_scope` (a file, directory, or `--changes`). With no argument, the scope is
the latest git changes and `max_iterations` is 10.

---

## The state machine

Run these states in order. Each transition is a deterministic decision you make — not a
subagent's. Track `iter`, starting at 0.

```

### INIT  (cage)

1. Detect the test runner using `skills/shared/test-runner-detection.md`.
2. Run the **baseline suite** as a discrete Bash call and read `$?` directly. Guard **G1**:
   if the exit code is non-zero, the suite is red — go straight to **HALT**. Never refactor
   on a red suite (`rules/refactoring.md` §Safety). This is a `stop`.
3. Create or load `.refactor-loop-ledger.md` in the project root (format below). Write its
   header: `runner`, `baseline: green @ <git-sha>`, `iter: 0 / max <N>`, and the `pinned:`
   list. Write the active-run marker so the Stop hook (G10) knows this is a refactor-loop
   session.
4. Snapshot the pinned constraints into the ledger header — the durable, compaction-immune
   source (G7). Default pinned set: `preserve-public-api`, `no-test-file-writes`.
5. If the ledger has no nodes yet, gather candidate smells for the `target_scope`. You may
   run `/phil:review-code <scope>` to seed nodes, then convert its backlog into ledger nodes.
6. Set `iter = 0`. Proceed to PROPOSE.

### PROPOSE  (brain → cage)

1. **Guard G8 (every step):** if `iter ≥ max_iterations`, go to HALT-INCOMPLETE.
2. Re-assert the pinned constraints from the ledger header (**G7**) before invoking.
3. Invoke `refactor-proposer` via the Task/Agent tool. Pass it the curated state — and only
   that: `pinned_constraints[]`, `ledger_open_nodes[]` (status `pending` only — never pass
   reverted nodes or their invalidated dependents), `last_failure_evidence?`, `target_scope`.
   Do **not** pass prior proposer reasoning traces.
4. If the proposer returns `"no actionable proposal"`, go to **DONE** (T2).
5. **Guard G6 (schema):** if the manifest is not schema-valid JSON (§ proposer output),
   re-ask once. A second malformed return → log it, mark the node skipped, return to PROPOSE.
6. Otherwise proceed to REVIEW with the manifest.

### REVIEW  (brain → cage)

1. Invoke `refactor-critic-correctness` via the Task/Agent tool. Pass `{ diff, original_code,
   stated_intent (one line, NOT the proposer's trace), rubric_slice (Slice 1 of
   `refactor/rubric.md`), pinned_constraints }`. Do **not** pass the proposer's reasoning —
   the critic must judge independently.
2. **Guard G6 (schema):** malformed verdict → re-ask once, then skip as above.
3. Proceed to GUARD with the verdict JSON.

### GUARD  (cage — pure boolean, no LLM)

Route on `verdict + severity + confidence`, threshold **θ = 0.6**:

- **G5:** if `verdict = reject`, OR any `per_criterion` item has `severity ≥ major` and
  `confidence ≥ 0.6` → back-prompt the proposer (`llm_self_examine`): return to PROPOSE with
  the failing `per_criterion` items as `last_failure_evidence`. Increment `iter`.
- If `verdict ∈ {accept, revise}` with no blocking item → proceed to APPLY (T4).
- A `CANNOT_ASSESS` verdict is **not** an accept — treat it as `revise` and back-prompt.

### APPLY  (cage)

1. Make a clean `git` checkpoint of the working tree (so a revert is a single
   `git checkout`).
2. Apply the proposer's single diff to disk.
3. **Guard G2** is enforced by the PreToolUse hook: any Edit/Write touching a test path is
   blocked at the tool boundary (`stop`). You do not need to re-check it, but never attempt
   a test-file write yourself.

### TEST  (cage)

Run the hard gate as **discrete Bash calls**, reading `$?` after each. A non-zero exit cannot
be narrated past — branch on the actual code.

1. `lint` → read `$?`.
2. `types` (if the project has a type checker) → read `$?`.
3. `tests` → read `$?`.
4. Compute the **actual** test delta and a **public-API diff**:
   - Public-API diff is language-specific. **Python:** `__all__` + top-level `def`/`class`.
     **TypeScript:** exported declarations. For other languages, degrade to the manifest's
     own `public_api_touched` claim (no independent API diff in v1) — note the degradation.
5. **Guard G3 (hard-gate-red):** any non-zero exit → REVERT (chained G3a).
6. **Guard G4 (manifest-mismatch):** the actual test delta contradicts
   `predicted_regressions_risk`, OR the public-API diff contradicts `public_api_touched`
   (e.g. the manifest claims `false` but the API changed) → REVERT. The proposer never
   self-certifies; the measured contract wins.
7. All gates green AND manifest matches → LEDGER (green path, T7).

### REVERT  (cage)

1. **G3a:** `git checkout -- <changed files>` to restore the pre-APPLY state.
2. Record the failing evidence (test output or the mismatch) on the node.
3. Mark the node `reverted`. **Auto-invalidate dependents:** walk the DAG transitive closure
   of the reverted node and set every node that depends on it to `invalid`. Invalidated nodes
   are never passed to a future PROPOSE.
4. Proceed to LEDGER.

### LEDGER  (cage)

1. Mark the current node `resolved` (green) or `reverted`/`invalid` (red path, already done
   in REVERT).
2. **G7:** re-assert the pinned constraints in the ledger header. Update `iter` in the
   header.
3. Prune: scan `pending` nodes for smells the just-applied refactoring incidentally resolved;
   mark them `resolved-incidental`.
4. Evaluate the stop predicate (next).

### DONE  (cage — computed predicate, never a vibe)

Reach DONE when **`green ∧ ¬∃ node(severity ≥ major ∧ confidence ≥ 0.6 unresolved) ∧
iter < max`**, or when the proposer returned `"no actionable proposal"`. The predicate is
computable; the proposer never gets to assert it.

If the suite was already green with no actionable proposals, report **"nothing to do"** — not
"converged after improvements." A no-op is not a success story.

### HALT  (cage)

Reach HALT when `iter ≥ max_iterations` (**G8**) or the baseline was red (**G1**). Report the
**incomplete** state honestly — what was resolved, what remains, why it stopped. Never narrate
a partial run as success; grade the final state, not the effort.

> **v1 HALT limitation (accepted).** v1 supports interrupt-only abort (Ctrl-C / Esc) plus the
> G8 max-iterations HALT. The sentinel-file user-abort (G9) — a top-priority abort that wins
> over an in-progress APPLY from every state — is **deferred to v2** (Workflow-tool returned
> status). Safety invariant #3's "always-reachable abort" is therefore only partially
> satisfied in v1. This is a documented, accepted limitation.

## The ledger — `.refactor-loop-ledger.md` (project root)

A dependency **DAG**, not a flat list. A reverted prerequisite voids its dependents.

```markdown
# Refactor-Loop Ledger
runner: pytest
baseline: green @ <git-sha>
iter: 7 / max 10
pinned: [preserve-public-api, no-test-file-writes]
active-run: true

## Nodes
| id   | smell            | span               | depends_on | status     | note |
|------|------------------|--------------------|------------|------------|------|
| R031 | Long Function    | order.py:42-87     | -          | resolved   | Extract Function, green @sha |
| R042 | Feature Envy     | order.py:90-110    | R031       | reverted   | red: test_discount; deps invalidated |
| R043 | Primitive Obsess | order.py:90-110    | R042       | invalid    | auto: prerequisite R042 reverted |
| R051 | Magic Number     | tax.py:12          | -          | pending    | |
```

Status lifecycle:

```
pending ─►(applied+green)─► resolved
pending ─►(applied+red)──► reverted ──► [each n with this node in depends_on → invalid]
pending ─►(smell gone)───► resolved-incidental
```

The header (`runner`, `baseline`, `iter`, `pinned`, `active-run`) is the durable,
compaction-immune source. Re-read it each iteration; do not trust the rolling context for the
pinned constraints. `active-run: true` plus the ledger's existence is the sentinel that gates
the Stop hook (G10) so it never traps unrelated sessions. Clear `active-run` at DONE/HALT.

---

## The guard set (G1–G10)

| Guard | Fires at | Predicate | Outcome class | Where enforced |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** baseline-green | INIT suite finishes | suite exit ≠ 0 | `stop` → HALT | this skill (Bash `$?`) |
| **G2** test-file-write-block | before any Edit/Write | path matches test glob | `stop` (block write) | **PreToolUse hook** |
| **G3** hard-gate-red | TEST suite finishes | exit ≠ 0 | `stop` + G3a | this skill (Bash `$?`) |
| **G3a** auto-revert | chained from G3 | — | `invoke_action` | `git checkout` |
| **G4** manifest-mismatch | TEST finishes | actual delta ≠ manifest, or API diff ≠ claim | `stop` + G3a | this skill |
| **G5** verdict-route | post-REVIEW | reject ∨ (severity≥major ∧ conf≥0.6) | `llm_self_examine` | this skill (back-prompt) |
| **G6** schema-valid | proposer/critic finishes | output not schema-valid | `llm_self_examine` | this skill (re-ask once) |
| **G7** pinned-reinject | every LEDGER / iteration boundary | always | `invoke_action` | this skill + **UserPromptSubmit hook** |
| **G8** max-iterations | every step | `iter ≥ max` | `stop` → HALT-INCOMPLETE | this skill |
| **G10** anti-premature-exit | session Stop | DONE predicate not satisfied | `invoke_action` | **Stop hook** (re-inject) |

Guards are essentially free to evaluate — gate liberally on the recurring invariants
(red suite, test-file touched, public-API changed, max-iterations). Do not hand-author a
guard per code smell; that is the rubric's job.

> **G9 (user-abort sentinel) is deferred to v2.** See the HALT limitation note above.

## Hooks — wiring is a human follow-up

This loop relies on three hooks: **G2** (PreToolUse test-file write-block), **G10** (Stop
anti-premature-exit, gated on the `active-run` sentinel), and **G7** (UserPromptSubmit pinned
re-inject). The scripts live in `hooks/refactor-loop/` and the exact `hooks.json` merge
snippet is in `hooks/refactor-loop/README.md`.

The plugin already ships a `Stop` hook in `hooks/hooks.json`. Do **not** blindly overwrite
it. Merge the new entries (the existing Stop notification and the new gated Stop guard can
coexist as separate entries in the `Stop` array). If wiring risks clobbering existing
config, leave it to the user: tell them to run the `update-config` skill with the snippet
from the README rather than editing config blindly. Surface this as the one item needing
human follow-up.

Until the hooks are wired, the loop still runs but loses defence-in-depth: G2/G10/G7 fall
back to the in-prose checks in this skill. Wire the hooks to make the boundaries sound.

---

## Self-test

`refactor/self-test/` holds deliberately-bad refactorings that the loop **must** reject — a
diff that breaks a test (must REVERT at G3), a diff that broadens the public API while
claiming `public_api_touched: false` (must REVERT at G4), and a "perfect refactor!" verdict
with no span (must be coerced to `CANNOT_ASSESS`). These are the regression gate for the
frozen rubric: run them whenever `refactor/rubric.md` changes. See that directory's README.

---

## Safety rules

- Never refactor on a red suite. G1 halts at baseline; G3 reverts mid-loop.
- One refactoring per gate pass — each breakage is attributable to one change, and revert is
  a single `git checkout`.
- The proposer never edits tests and never runs the suite; the critic never edits or runs
  anything. Behavior preservation is certified only by the external suite plus the
  manifest-vs-actual check.
- More iterations is not better. The `max_iterations` cap is a feature; a loop that keeps
  going is not a loop that is improving.
- Report the final state honestly at DONE and HALT. Never fake success.

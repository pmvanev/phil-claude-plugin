description: Skill bundle for the phil:groom-issues command — reads a whole issue board in one call per forge and reports what is wrong with it, against a stated standard for what a well-formed issue contains. Derives the defect table fresh every run, stores no grooming marker, surfaces cross-issue candidates without acting on them, and changes nothing.

# Groom issues — say what is wrong with a board

A board accumulates cards that someone filed half-finished. Reading them one at a time finds the
sloppy ones and misses the expensive ones, because the costly defects live *between* issues.

**Slice 01 scope: this reads and reports. It changes nothing.** Fixing within a scope is slice 02;
merging, splitting, closing and grouping are slice 03 and are never applied unasked. Do not
improvise either.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND: `phil:issue-board`.** Every forge mechanic — `-R` targeting, label semantics,
absolute-URL rules, dependency links, generated blocks — lives there. Do not guess any of it here.

## The standard — what a well-formed issue contains

Without this, "appropriate description" is not checkable and grooming is taste. This is the house
default. **A project may override it in its own `CLAUDE.md`**, beside the per-project setup block
`phil:issue-board` already prescribes; where it does, that override wins and this section is ignored.

A well-formed issue has:

1. **A purpose readable without context** — what and why, in the body. A title is not a purpose, and
   the next reader is a stranger or a forgetful you.
2. **A way to tell when it is done** — acceptance criteria, or an outcome concrete enough to check.
3. **Links that resolve.** Absolute URLs for files, because GitHub emits relative paths verbatim and
   they 404. Bare `#N` for issues, because a bare reference renders live title and state where a
   markdown link freezes both. **This rule is about the form, and the form is fully checkable here** —
   a relative path is a finding whether or not its target exists, because the form 404s either way.
   Whether a correctly-formed link *reaches* something is a different question, and it belongs to the
   cross-reference row of the defect table below, which is where it goes dark.
4. **Correct labels**, with single-valued families carrying exactly one value — **checkable only where
   the project declares which families are single-valued.** Nothing in a label's name says whether it
   excludes a sibling; GitHub has no scoped labels at all. `documentation` + `enhancement` on one issue
   is a defect or two orthogonal facts depending on a convention no forge records. Absent a declaration
   in the project's `CLAUDE.md`, report this rule **unevaluated**. Do not infer the family from the
   labels in use — that makes the most common pairing the rule, and then the board's habits audit
   themselves.
5. **A `## Chain` section when blocked or related** — the edge *and* the reason it exists.

And it does **not** contain:

- **Session scratch or working state.** It belongs in the git-ignored local surface (ADR-013); a
  board is world-readable.
- **Hand-written content inside a generated region** — anything between `nwave:status` markers is
  regenerated, so a hand edit is destroyed on the next refresh and disagrees with its source until
  then.
- **A second copy of something the forge already keeps** — a roster where sub-issues exist, an order
  where position holds it. The copy is the one that goes stale.

## Scan once, derive fresh

**One call per forge**, bodies included:

```sh
gh issue list -R <owner/repo> --state open --json number,title,body,labels,milestone --limit 200
glab issue list -R <group/project> --output json --per-page 100
```

On `glab`, the JSON flag is **`-O`/`--output`**. `-F` is `--output-format` and takes
`details|ids|urls` — hand it `json` and it silently returns the human-readable table. Both commands
return bodies populated, so there is no N+1 and no reason to fetch issues individually.

**Never read or write a grooming marker.** No `groomed` label, no timestamp block, no state file. The
defect table is re-derived on every run. A stored marker becomes a second authority the moment
somebody edits a groomed issue — the exact failure `phil:issue-board` forbids under *One system of
record per scope* — and re-deriving costs one call.

The visible consequence, which the report must own: **a candidate the user declined will be proposed
again next run.** That is the price of storing nothing. Say so plainly, or it reads as the tool
forgetting and the user starts asking for the marker this rule exists to refuse.

## The defect table

Every finding names the rule it violates and quotes the evidence. A finding without both is an
opinion, and this skill does not report opinions.

Classify each, because slice 02 acts only on the first column:

| Mechanical — one right answer | Semantic — needs a human |
|---|---|
| A relative file link (404s on GitHub) | No purpose stated |
| An issue reference wrapped in markdown that should be bare | No way to tell when it is done |
| A single-valued label family carrying two values, where the project declares the family | Session scratch in the body |
| A missing cross-reference whose target is unambiguous | A second copy of forge-kept state the body's argument leans on |
| A second copy of forge-kept state that only restates it | Deciding which of those two a copy is |

**The cross-reference row needs a check this command cannot run.** "Unambiguous" means the target
exists and is pushed, which `phil:issue-board` establishes with
`git ls-tree origin/<default-branch> -- <path>` — outside a `Bash` scoped to `gh issue list` /
`glab issue list`, and deliberately so. A bare file path in a body is therefore a **candidate**, not a
finding: report it as unverified and say what would settle it. Promoting it anyway produces the failure
`phil:issue-board` warns about from the other direction — a link that renders, passes a read-back, and
404s for everyone else.

**A stale copy of forge state is two defects wearing one name.** The row used to sit wholly in the
semantic column, and a real run split it. Where the copy only restates what the forge holds — a prose
roster beside real sub-issues — deleting it loses nothing and the forge answers instead. Where the
copy is load-bearing — a card justifying its own existence by describing the board's current shape —
deleting it removes the argument, and only a human can say what replaces it.

Detection costs nothing either way: one `--json` call returns the body and the fields it contradicts,
so the comparison is inside the payload already fetched. **Read the two sides against each other on
every run** — a body asserting a sibling shipped, a parent listing children, a card citing a column's
contents. The prose keeps its confident tone long after the forge has moved.

Note what that does to the row's own classification: **the judgement comes before the fix**, so a later
slice cannot delete a stale copy unasked even when deletion turns out to be mechanical. It has to
establish which kind it is holding first, and that question is the human's.

**Do not report a missing `Work this with:` line as a body defect.** That line is generated into the
delimited block by `phil:nwave-issue-board`; its absence is a publishing question, not a content one,
and hand-writing it would be typing into a generated region.

## Cross-issue candidates — surface, never act

These cannot be found by reading one issue, which is why the scan is whole-board. Report each with
its evidence and stop; every one is expensive to undo and belongs to slice 03.

- **Duplicates** — quote the overlapping content from both. Partial overlap is the real case and is
  not automatically a merge; it may be a split or a dependency.
- **Oversized** — a card carrying work that cannot be demonstrated on its own. Name the seam.
- **Overcome by events** — the work landed another way, or the decision behind it was reversed.
- **Ungrouped effort** — a card belonging to a larger effort that says so nowhere. A milestone is a
  goal (`phil:issue-board`); do not invent a second convention.

## Reporting

Lead with the shape of the board, not the findings:

```
57 issues read · 52 clean · 3 with body defects · 2 duplicate candidates · 1 oversized
```

Then the defects, grouped by issue, each citing its rule and evidence. Then the cross-issue
candidates. Then, if anything was declined on a previous run, the note that it will reappear.

**A clean board is reported clean.** Do not manufacture findings to justify the run — that is how a
grooming tool teaches people to stop running it.

**A partial read may never make a completeness claim.** If pagination failed, the forge was
unreachable, or the limit truncated the list, say the read was partial and report *only* what was
found. "52 clean" over a partial scan is the single most misleading thing this skill can emit,
because it is a claim about issues nobody looked at.

**A rule that could not be evaluated is not a rule that passed.** Two checks go dark routinely: rule 4
wherever the project declares no label family, and the cross-reference row wherever a target cannot be
confirmed pushed. Both then produce no findings, and no findings reads as compliance. Name them, with
the reason:

```
rules 1, 2, 3, 5 evaluated · rule 4 unevaluated (no label family declared in CLAUDE.md)
· 6 unlinked paths unverified (target check needs git, out of scope here)
```

This is the partial-read failure one rule narrower, and it hides better — the issue count is honest,
so nothing in the summary looks incomplete. A reader who is told the board is clean will not ask which
rules were awake.

**Say a check went dark only when it had something to decide.** A board where no issue carries two
labels does not need rule 4's oracle, and reporting it unevaluated there is boilerplate — which is how
a caveat stops being read by the run that needs it. The note is owed when a candidate existed and the
check could not settle it: two labels and no declared family, an unlinked path and no way to confirm
the target. No candidate, no note.

## What this skill must never do

- **Write anything.** No issue edits, no labels, no comments, no milestones. Read-only is the slice.
- Read or write a grooming marker, in any form.
- Report a finding without the rule it violates and the evidence for it.
- Claim completeness over a partial read.
- Let a rule that could not be evaluated pass for a rule that was satisfied.
- Report a missing generated line as a body defect.
- Merge, split, close, or group — slice 03, and never unasked even then.

## Acceptance

`self-test/` holds the fixtures. Run them whenever this file, the command loader, or
`phil:issue-board`'s body-relevant sections change.
